## 🎯 Project Management Process Overview

### Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to learn and adapt quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, experimentation, and learning

### Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality standards and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

> 📖 For detailed role descriptions and responsibilities, see [OctoAcme Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)

### Project Lifecycle Phases

#### 1. 🚀 Initiation
The first phase focuses on validating the problem and aligning stakeholders before committing resources.

- Problem validation and business need confirmation
- Stakeholder identification and alignment
- Creation of Project One-pager with problem statement and goals
- Success metrics definition
- Initial timeline and resource estimation
- Go/no-go decision gate

#### 2. 📋 Planning
Turn approved initiatives into actionable plans with clear delivery roadmaps.

- Backlog creation with prioritized, estimated work items
- Sprint/iteration planning with defined capacity
- Risk identification and dependency mapping
- Release planning with milestone definitions
- Definition of Done (DoD) establishment
- Test and QA approach planning

#### 3. ⚙️ Execution & Tracking
Manage day-to-day delivery with consistent rhythm and quality standards.

- **Daily standups**: 15-minute check-ins focused on progress and blockers
- **Pull Request workflows**: Small PRs with clear acceptance criteria, automated testing, and peer review
- **Quality assurance**: Unit tests, integration tests, and security scanning
- **Metrics tracking**: Monitor velocity, burndown, and success metrics
- **Project board management**: Track work through Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done

#### 4. 🚢 Release & Deployment
Deploy features to production with risk mitigation and observability.

- **Release types**: Patch (hotfixes), Minor (incremental features), Major (significant changes)
- **Pre-release requirements**: All acceptance criteria met, passing CI/security scans, release notes drafted
- **Deployment checklist**: Staging validation, smoke tests, production deployment, post-deploy verification
- **Rollback procedures**: Incident response and rollback to last known-good release if needed

#### 5. 🔄 Retrospective
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

- What went well / what could be improved
- Action item identification with clear owners
- Follow-up on previous retrospective commitments
- Continuous improvement culture

### Communication Cadence

- **Weekly syncs**: PM + Product Manager alignment
- **Daily standups**: Delivery team (15 minutes)
- **Twice-weekly standups**: As agreed by team
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Broader organizational communication
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for critical issues

### Risk Management

- **Risk Register**: Maintained with ID, description, impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plan
- **Escalation paths**: Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- **Mitigation strategies**: Proactive identification, assessment, and continuous monitoring
- **Weekly reviews**: Risk status updates in team syncs
