# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Use the [Action Item Follow-up Checklist](action-item-follow-up-checklist.md) to ensure accountability

### Action Item Follow-up Process
1. **Capture**: Document all action items during the retrospective with specific owners and due dates
2. **Track**: Add action items to a dedicated tracking board or backlog with the label `retrospective-action`
3. **Review**: Start each retrospective by reviewing status of previous action items
4. **Measure**: Track completion rate and time-to-resolution for continuous improvement
5. **Celebrate**: Acknowledge completed improvements to reinforce positive change

### Follow-up Schedule
- **Week 1 after retro**: Owner provides initial progress update in weekly PM sync
- **Week 2 after retro**: Mid-point check-in if action item is not yet complete
- **Next retrospective**: Formal review of all action items from previous retro
- **Overdue items**: Escalate to PM if action items are more than 2 weeks overdue without progress

## Example Action Item Template
- **Title**: [Clear, action-oriented description]
- **Description**: [Detailed context and expected outcome]
- **Owner**: [Name of accountable person]
- **Due date**: [Specific date, typically 1-4 weeks out]
- **Success criteria**: [How we'll know this is complete]
- **Related to**: [Link to original retrospective notes or issue]
- **Status**: [Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Complete]

## Best Practices for Action Items
- **Be specific**: Vague action items rarely get completed. "Improve documentation" should become "Add error handling examples to API docs by [date]"
- **Single owner**: Multiple owners often means no owner. Assign one accountable person, even if others contribute
- **Right-sized scope**: Action items should be completable in 1-4 weeks. Break larger improvements into phases
- **Measurable outcomes**: Define clear success criteria so completion is unambiguous
- **Review regularly**: Don't let action items languish. Review status weekly and adjust or close as needed

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items using the metrics and guidelines in the [Action Item Follow-up Checklist](action-item-follow-up-checklist.md)
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Review completion rates to continuously improve the retrospective process itself
