# Action Item Follow-up Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure retrospective action items are tracked, completed, and their impact is measured. This checklist supports accountability and continuous improvement.

## When to Use
- During and immediately after every retrospective
- In weekly PM syncs for status updates
- Before the next retrospective to review completion

---

## During the Retrospective

### Action Item Creation
- [ ] Each action item has a clear, specific title
- [ ] Description includes context and expected outcome
- [ ] Single owner is assigned (not a group or team)
- [ ] Realistic due date is set (typically 1-4 weeks)
- [ ] Success criteria are defined and measurable
- [ ] Priority level is assigned (High/Medium/Low)

### Documentation
- [ ] Action items are recorded in retrospective notes
- [ ] Items are added to project backlog/board with `retrospective-action` label
- [ ] Link to source retrospective is included in each action item
- [ ] Team agrees on the prioritized list of action items

---

## Week 1 After Retrospective

### Owner Responsibilities
- [ ] Review assigned action item(s) and understand scope
- [ ] Break down into smaller tasks if needed
- [ ] Identify any dependencies or blockers
- [ ] Begin work or create detailed plan

### PM Responsibilities
- [ ] Confirm all action items are in backlog/tracking system
- [ ] Check in with owners during weekly sync
- [ ] Document initial progress update
- [ ] Flag any immediate blockers for resolution

---

## Week 2 After Retrospective

### Mid-point Check
- [ ] Review progress on all in-flight action items
- [ ] Identify items at risk of missing due dates
- [ ] Adjust due dates or scope if needed (document changes)
- [ ] Escalate persistent blockers to Product Lead
- [ ] Celebrate any completed items

---

## Next Retrospective (Week 3-4)

### Action Item Review
- [ ] Create summary of previous retrospective's action items
- [ ] Categorize items: Completed / In Progress / Not Started / Cancelled
- [ ] For completed items: Measure and discuss impact
- [ ] For incomplete items: Understand why and decide next steps
  - [ ] Extend deadline with clear reason?
  - [ ] Re-scope or break down further?
  - [ ] Cancel if no longer relevant?
  - [ ] Carry forward to next sprint?

### Documentation
- [ ] Update status of all action items in tracking system
- [ ] Document lessons learned about follow-through
- [ ] Archive completed items with outcomes noted
- [ ] Calculate and track action item completion rate

---

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate to PM when:
- [ ] Action item is blocked for more than 1 week
- [ ] Action item is more than 2 weeks overdue with no progress
- [ ] Owner unable to complete due to capacity constraints
- [ ] Action requires cross-team coordination not progressing

Escalate to Product Lead when:
- [ ] PM escalation hasn't resolved blocker within 1 week
- [ ] Action requires executive decision or resource reallocation
- [ ] Pattern of incomplete action items indicates systemic issue

---

## Metrics to Track

Track these metrics over time to improve action item completion:

- **Completion rate**: % of action items completed by due date
- **Time to completion**: Average days from creation to completion
- **Carry-forward rate**: % of items that extend beyond original sprint
- **Cancellation rate**: % of items cancelled (helps identify overcommitment)
- **Impact measurement**: Qualitative assessment of improvement from completed items

---

## Tips for Success

**For Action Item Owners:**
- Treat retrospective action items like regular work—schedule time for them
- Communicate proactively if you encounter blockers or need to adjust timeline
- Don't wait until the due date to start; begin in the first week
- Ask for help early if the scope is unclear or larger than expected

**For Project Managers:**
- Make action item review a standing agenda item in weekly syncs
- Keep the list short—better to complete 2-3 items than start 10 and finish none
- Celebrate completions to reinforce the importance of follow-through
- Don't be afraid to cancel items that are no longer relevant

**For the Team:**
- Be honest about capacity when committing to action items
- If completion rates are consistently low, retrospective on the retrospective process itself
- Link action items to specific pain points—abstract improvements are harder to prioritize
- Share ownership of the continuous improvement culture
